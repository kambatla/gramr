Gramr (Graph Algorithms in MapReduce)
-------------------------------------

Implementations of a bunch of graph algorithms using MapReduce, meant
for large-scale graphs.

The code is split into:
- io: to read/write graphs in different formats
- kernels: common graph (adjacency matrix) operations
- algos: graph algorithms built using kernels
